6. Model Interpretation and Discussion:

** Model Selection **

Based on the evaluation of the performance metrics, the best-performing model for the California Housing dataset was the Random Forest Regression model. It outperformed other models with a lower mean squared error, lower mean absolute error, and a higher R-squared score.
The Random Forest Regression model is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It works by building a large number of decision trees and then averaging their predictions to make the final prediction.

** Strengths and Weaknesses of model **

*Random Forest Regression:*

Strengths:
1. Good performance on many  complex problems
2. Can handle both numerical and categorical features.
3. Can handle non-linear relationships between features and target variable.

Weaknesses:
1. Can be computationally expensive and time-consuming for large datasets.
2. Can be difficult to interpret compared to decision trees.
3. No interpretability.

 ** Why it outperforms other models? **

RFR outperforms other models because is its ability to handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. It also reduces overfitting by randomly selecting a subset of features and samples for each tree. Additionally, it can handle missing values and outliers. It also has good performance metrics, such as low mean squared error and high R-squared value, indicating that it can accurately 
predict house prices.


** Insights into the features **

To determine the features that have the most significant impact on house prices based on the chosen model,To do this, we can use the feature_importances_ attribute of the Random Forest model to determine the importance of each feature.
